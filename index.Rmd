#often no link between data and script --> makes replicating study challenging. More journals are
#requiring submissions of scripts with publication

#reproducible research can be done through literate programming and version control

#literate programming:
#incorporating code inside report --> links data and code
#R notebooks: allows to generate code and produce a report
#R Markdown: language used to create R notebooks
#R code is integrated in Markdown language, which is converted into HTML and compromise the report
#In reality, Notebook is created in Rmd file (R mark down), uses a package called called knitr which converses it into md (Markdown)
# the md file is converted into HTML by pandoc

#create new project and pick simple R markdown website (here named site.yml)
#to avoid issues with working directories, easiest to pick associate with existing working directory
#creates three files aoutomatically and a website with two tabs: site.yml, about.Rmd, index.Rmd
#site.yml: name of project, is the website
#can change the title of the website, e.g. "my notebook" by changing the name in the name and main title 

#can edit the names of the tabs and edit their names in the project file site.yml
#tab called home linked with index.html and a file called about linked to about.html
#to build website, go to tab buildin  the top right corner
#to view website, can use knit (above script, updates website you are working with) or build website (updates project)

#if click build website, can see the two tabs "about" and "index". 
#can change the title of the tabs in text

#can add another tab
#by adding additional line including text: and href:
#then create new folder in files in working directory (right hand corner) with the same name and save as .Rmd file (here analysis.Rmd)

- text: "analysis"
href: analysis.html
#To be able to start editing it, need to creade Rmd file for it first
#in the file, remove the line "output" as otherwise interfers the other sites saved as notebook not as an hdml

#the working directory:
#all files are kept in this folder
#specify where to save your files when creating project
#By saving all files in the working directory using a relative path, do not have to
#specify the absolute path to the working directory every time

#for reproducibilty, always use relative paths by working from working directory and assuming other people will
#within working directory, have a folder for data, one for figures and one for project

#to enter text in rmd file that does not show in output file, use <!--enter text here-->

<!--1.the main heading (Title, author, date) between --- ... ---
quotation marks not required for text

2. Headings: add # followed by a space, one hash is the biggest heading, the more hashes the smaller headings

3. text after  heading-->

<!--if want to refer to another heading, need to give headings a reference ID by using curly breackets, followed by hash and heading ID using hash.
To refer to it, add text in curly brackets followed by #heading ID in brackets-->

<!--can also make a footnote-->

## Lists

1. Item 1  
<!--to add sub item enter 4 spaces before-->
    a. sub item 1a
    b. sub item 1b
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

<!--for bulletet points, use asterix-->

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

<!--insert images-->

# Images
<!--advisable to save all images in an img folder in working directory. Cal click new folder in files tab-->
<!--to add image, use ! followed by figure aption in square brackets and then relative path in the brackets with name of image and type of image file. No spaces allowed in image name path
specify size if want to in curly brackets-->


![This is the figure caption](img/2013-07-12Llamas,alpacasyguanacos088.jpg){width=250px}

# Tables
<!-- write content of table inside straigh line, where each column heading seperated by straight line. However, markdown not ideal for creating tables manually-->

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Item 1   | Item 2   |

# Blocks

<!--use back ticks to create blocks-->
```
print "Hello world"

```

#inserting R code chunks
<!--at top bar, c+ sign allowing to add insert which specifies the code is in r, can be done manually (without hash tags)
#```{r}
#...enter code here...
#```-->

<!--create a new data folder into working directory, then download script in console once in the data folder using following link download.file(url="https://github.com/cambiotraining/reproducibility-training/blob/master/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile="data/gapminder_data.csv")-->

<!-- by default any message or warning in your R script will be displayed, such as packages installed.
to remove these messages, use chunk options

echo-=FALSE does not display the code but it displays the results in the rendered file
message=FALSE does not display an message that are generated by the code chunk in the rendered file
warning=FALSE does not display warning that are generated by rendered file-->
